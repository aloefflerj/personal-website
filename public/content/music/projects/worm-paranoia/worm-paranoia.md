## Worm Paranoia 

_"Worm Paranoia"_ is an _"under the radar"_, _"underground"_, _"low production"_, and _"introspective"_ music composition project that aims to capture some _"90's cartoonish"_ vibe if that makes any sense whatsoever :frog:.

It currently has a total of `0` songs.

The name is inspired by the episode [Tales of Worm Paranoia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1211320/) of the American animated anthology series [What a Cartoon!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_a_Cartoon!).
