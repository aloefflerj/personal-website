## Cardinal World
This is a fantasy world where people live in the mountains due to a toxic gas that floats below certain altitude. The toxic gas zone extends to the sea level.

Wind instruments can actually call the wind. So people use it both to blow the gas away and to navigate their baloons between different mountains.
